_La La Land_ is charming like nothing else: everything from the sentimental music, the fanciful images, the idealistic story — completely romantic and mesmerizing. Chazelle’s previous work, _Whiplash_, was similarly stunning. But _Whiplash_ was angry, hysterical, dangerous, saturated with sweat, tear, blood, and a risky devotion, whereas _La La Land_ is clear, transparent, magnificent and dreamy.

It’s easily the most impressive film of 2016, but many say the imperfect ending makes it unfit for the holidays and Valentines. Yet it’s precisely the imperfections that make this story of lovers and dreamers real, precious, and unforgettable.

## Love and Dreams

Upon reviewing the story, we might conclude that Sebastian and Mia were never made for each other. Friendship and love found during unfortunate times can sometimes be attributed to simply the comfort in having someone to vent all the pessimism to and earn encouraging words from — and that might just be the case for Mia and Sebastian. They found their own hopes in each other, and their way of expressing love was offering comfort when they can’t realize those hopes. Love is one of the few things they have left in their exhausted lives. It sounds wonderful on paper, but not so pretty when put into practice. That’s why the epilogue, the fantasy of them dancing in the stars, is fundamentally a paradox — if they couldn’t adapt to each other, how could they manage living together for the rest of their lives?

It’s easy to say “I love you,” but how many people can actually say that they’ve **_really_** loved? To love is to take the responsibility of your actions and to accept the weaknesses in yourself and others. We shouldn’t always live in such grand self-consolation.

I’d think Mia is, after all, selfish. She had a successful, rich boyfriend whom she dumped, and it would be logical to induce that the only reason she chose Sebastian is because she saw herself in him. The depressed, dejected dream chaser. In reality, however, there wasn’t ever a chance for her to give up everything for him. When Sebastian was on tour, slowly becoming the successful musician he’s always wanted to be, she was looking for proof that he wasn’t happy. But Sebastian does love music, and who said he didn't love touring? Mia felt imbalanced: when the dreams they associated with each other came true, they suddenly couldn’t bear each other anymore.

Ultimately, the dream that united them is precisely what separated them. Sebastian thought he found the love of his life, but really, it’s just that in a particular place, at a particular time, he met someone who needed someone. In the end, perhaps they both loved their dreams more than they loved love.

## Dream and Stars

Or perhaps, neither of them needed a happily ever after. LA has boundless deserts, but at the end of those deserts, there’s the splendor of the city and the equally boundless sea. The blue ocean embraces the blue sky, just like idealists embracing the ephemeral joy, even if thunderclouds might descend the very next second.

Countless dreamers, like Mia, come to Hollywood in search of their aspirations. Countless dreams are shattered here. Yet for as long as there's people young and old, searching, looking,  the stars will never dim, and everything will always be ever so glorious. This city of star is the lovely night under the purplish nightfall, the pier shrouded by the brilliant dawn, the dinner club with a piano lit by the dim lamp light. It’s where music never stops. It’s a dreamland where all the colors are bright, pure, where even the air seems intoxicated with sweetness.

Does such a charming world exist? We all know the answer to that. The road to dreams is difficult, with steep and rocky inclines, with thorns and spikes and prickles. The city of star doesn’t shine for anyone in particular. The people who realize their dreams are few, yet who can say, with confidence and assurance, that those who try are fools?

## The Road to Dreams

Dreams are constant variables of all our lives. It’s just that some have changed, some have given up, but some have kept them all along. At the end of the film, the two met in the jazz club, both clutching their dreams. When their eyes met, both watery, were they not smiling?

La La Land can’t simply be classified as a tragic story. After all, Sebastian and Mia held on to their precious aspirations. Both becoming what they wanted to be. Both conquering the unthinkable future of the once discouraged dreamers. Both living exactly as they imagined 5 years ago: the girl now a renowned star, the guy now owning a jazz club — not many can afford such luxury.

As for the love, it forged both of their existences. Intentionally or not, they have affected each other's decision at an important junction in life. The two came together on the way to their dreams, and one pushed the other to success. Both of their dreams came true at the cost of losing each other.

We all have to give up something for our dreams. But in the end, they both found that someone in the crowd, whom they’ve waited for, whom they needed to know. After they’ve lifted each other off the ground, they went on to continue their lives. They might not have been ready to wholeheartedly love each other, but they did wholeheartedly need each other, help each other, and succeed for each other. And as such, despite the regrets and what-ifs, who can say that a not-happily ever after is not splendid and wonderful as well?
